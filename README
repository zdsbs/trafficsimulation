This is mostly a learning project where we are attempting to learn Clojure.  The nominal goal of the project is to create a traffic simultion that move autonomous cars around one or more streets, using some concepts from agent based modelling.

Things you can do right now:
- run all-tests.clj to run all the tests
- run simulation_controller.clj to run a small simulation of two cars on a single one lane road
- call (space) in road.clj to create a data structure representing a grid road system
